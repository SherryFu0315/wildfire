# Admin Helper Functions

Admin helper functions are created for resetting and clearing errors in your `wildfire` database.

### 1. Reset Discussion Count for All Pages

This function will recount the discussion total of all pages in your current `wildfire` database.

!> Note: If you've been using `wildfire` before `v0.3.0`, please run this function once to ensure that the discussion counts of your pages are correct.

!> Note: In future versions, the current implementation of displaying dicussion count on `header` will be deprecated. The new discussion count node data will be used instead. So again, please at least run this function once to make sure everything's correct if you are an early bird.
